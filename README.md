# Model-identification-and-state-estimation-for-a-multirotor-UAV
MATLAB project on data-driven system identification and state estimation for the ANT-X quadrotor UAV using a 2DoF experimental test-bed. Includes closed-loop longitudinal dynamics identification from flight data and the design of a discrete-time Kalman-based pitch attitude estimator using IMU measurements.
